# AnyoneAI - Project II
## Making Estimations with our NBA dataset

In our first project, we learn how to create our own datasets by using a public API, Python and Pandas. We're now going to explore how to make predictive models for regression and classification tasks using ScikitLearn

The goals of this project are:
* Learn how to define a prediction task
* Selecting evaluation metrics and baseline models
* Perform feature engineering and standarization
* Training and using predictive models: Univariable and Multivariate Linear Regression, Classification
* Understand how Gradient Descent works by implementing a Linear Regressor in Python
