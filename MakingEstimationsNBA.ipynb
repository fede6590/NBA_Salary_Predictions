A rookie contract value depends on the draft position. (Undrafted players have to negotiate a salary independently)\n","- Performance in statistical categories: after the rookie contract, players can negotiate freely with teams, and usually statistical categories like points, rebounds and assists are extremely important.  \n","- Team: Even though there are limits to what all teams can expend in players salary, they all allocate their resources differently, and can be more willing to pay the penalties incurred by exceeding those limitations.\n","- Year in which the contract was signed: the mininum and maximum values of contracts possibles in the NBA changes depending on league revenue (television contracts, sponsorships, etc), so if the amount of money the teams make increases, players can negotiate bigger contracts.\n","- Intangibles: players can be valued also in things that are not easily translated to a statistic, good defensive players might not always have great stats but can be extremely important for a team, the same can be said about veteran players that help young ones to learn and are good locker-room guys.\n","\n","But we're going to take a simplified approach, we'll try to use the data we already have to make the best estimator possible, and then we will analyze what went right and what could've gone wrong with our results."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from pandas.api.types import
